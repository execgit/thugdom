# Thug

Original Thug at https://github.com/buffer/thug and http://buffer.github.com/thug/

This is just a fork of Thug that emphasises on the DOM. Most external
dependencies are made optional to ease installation and package
management. Logging of DOM changes and JS evaluation
increased. Offline analysis capability emphasised.


Rationale: PyV8 lacks a good standalone DOM implementation for
javascript analysis.
